# math-estimation

Simple place where you can play with math estimation with nice visualization.

simply copy this into your terminal to get the demo locally
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/alexgnatrow/math-estimation
```

P.S. currently with rerender bug when all intervals are rendered. Probably the issue of [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3) or [function-plot](https://github.com/mauriciopoppe/function-plot) which I used for visualization. And they are awesome, I encourage you to check it out! Specifically the latter one, It's the best lib I have found so far for displaying functions.
